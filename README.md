# A sript to automatically merge pdfs
This script merges each pdf of the `input` folder with the pdf named `append.pdf` and writes the resulting files into an output folder (original files are note modified)

## How to use
- First you need to have python 3 installed on your computer
- Then you need to run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or `python -m pip install -m requirements.txt`)
- Then you can execute `merger.py` (double click on it or execute `python merger.py` in a terminal)
